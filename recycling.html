		        <h2>RECYCLING</h2>
               		
                      Residents are encouraged to recycle their household wastes as much as possible. We have re-cycle bins stationed throughout the estate, so please make full use of them. Collection is weekly on a Tuesday. If you would like to recycle your waste but are unable to use the recycle bin beside your block because it looks full, please use any of the other recycle bins around the estate. Blockages can be avoided by cutting up large cardboard boxes into smaller pieces before placing them in the recycle bins. If you would like to know more about recycling, please contact the housing office.
			<h3>To dispose of bulky wastes</h3>
			You can take larger items to one of the Reuse and Recycling Centres saving yourself the collection charge . Such us:
