		        <h2>Waltham Estate Resident Management Organization</h2>
               		 Our vision is for a resident-led enterprise recognised as a centre of excellence, working together, with a shared commitment, to provide good, modern housing and excellent housing services.

What is a tenant management organisation?
A tenant management organisation (TMO) is a means by which council tenants, leaseholders and freeholders can collectively take on responsibility for managing their homes (also referred to as a resident management organisation (e.g. Waltham Estate RMO).

The resident members of the TMO create an independent legal body and usually elect a tenant-led management committee to run the organisation. The TMO can then enter into a legal management agreement (contract) with the landlord (Lambeth Council). The TMO is paid an annual management and maintenance allowance in order to carry out management duties delegated to them.

The services managed by the TMO vary with local circumstances but may include day-to-day repairs, allocations and lettings, tenancy management, cleaning and caretaking.
