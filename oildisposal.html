		        <h2>DISPOSAL OF OIL</h2>
               		
                        <h3>Blocked drains on the estate.</h3>
According to a Thames Water Report, we have 366,000 sewer blockages in a year in the UK with more than three-quarters caused by fat, oil, grease and other items. There is a campaign from Thames Water with the slogan "Bin It and Don't Block it". This encourages households to dispose of their wastes including oily food properly.
</br></br>Cooking oil is something nearly every household uses but which many people are not sure of how to dispose of properly.</br></br>
Some residents dispose of their cooking oil in a manner that is not acceptable to the extent that the oil spills out of the bin chambers into the communal walkways. This is a health and safety hazard as anyone could easily slip and fall while passing through. The oil can also seep into the communal drains and block them, leading to a back surge inside residents' properties.
</br></br>The housing office had to use a variety of different chemicals to clean up the communal area of one of the estate's blocks and the bin chamber due to the oily substance carelessly disposed of by a resident a few weeks' ago. The housing office pays large sums of money to drain cleaning companies every time a resident reports a drain problem to the office or when we discover a blocked drain during walkabout. Any resident caught disposing of their cooking oil inappropriately or directly into the drain will be fined. 
</br></br>You should not pour cooking oil down the sink or into the drain because the fat, oil and grease solidify to form blockages especially during the winter period. Even if you breakdown the oil with soap and hot water, it can re-solidify once it cools down and causes the estate's drain pipes and sewers to become blocked. This leads to blocked sinks and toilet cisterns within the blocks. 
</br></br>The best option in disposing of your cooking oil is to put it in a tightly lid container before putting it in your bin bag. Fat traps can be made from containers such as margarine tubs and other plastics. Residents can also take their used cooking oil to the Household Waste and Recycling Centre Smugglers Way Wandsworth SW18 1JS. Lambeth residents can also deliver their used cooking oil to Lambeth Reuse And Recycling Centre, Vale Street, West Norwood SE27 9PA
