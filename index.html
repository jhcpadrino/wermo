					<h3>Waltham Residents  Management Organization</h3>
					<p>
						Our vision is for a resident-led enterprise recognised as a centre of excellence, 
						working together, with a shared commitment, to provide good, modern housing and excellent
						 housing services. What is a tenant management organisation? A tenant management organisation (TMO) 
						 is a means by which council tenants, leaseholders and freeholders can collectively take on responsibility 
						 for managing their homes (also referred to as a resident management organisation (e.g. Waltham Estate RMO). 
						 The resident members of the TMO create an independent legal body and usually elect a tenant-led management
						  committee to run the organisation. The TMO can then enter into a legal management agreement (contract) with
						   the landlord (Lambeth Council). The TMO is paid an annual management and maintenance allowance in order to
						    carry out management duties delegated to them. The services managed by the TMO vary with local circumstances 
					    but may include day-to-day repairs, allocations and lettings, tenancy management, cleaning and caretaking.
